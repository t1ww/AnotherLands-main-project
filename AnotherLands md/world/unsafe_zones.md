# 🌲 Unsafe Zones (Wildlands)

## Overview

Unsafe Zones are the areas between towns where the world becomes unpredictable, dangerous, and exploratory. Unlike towns, which act as hubs with crafting, storage, and trading facilities, unsafe zones are procedurally generated for each visit and emphasize **risk, resource gathering, and combat challenge**.

These areas define the `“wildlands”` of Another Lands: the player leaves the safety of civilization and must navigate environmental hazards, enemies, and strategic choices.

## Zone Structure

- **Procedural Generation:** Each visit generates the zone layout dynamically using room templates. Paths may be blocked or unblocked depending on environmental changes (e.g., dried rivers, fallen debris).
- **Exploration Choice:** Players may select difficulty levels for unsafe zones when entering from a town.
- **Environment Types:** Biomes vary, affecting enemies, loot, and hazards:

  - Ruined cities
  - Industrial wastelands
  - Forests with post-tech ruins
  - Desert zones
  - Snowfields or frost areas
  - Arcane anomalies
  - Cave and underground networks

## Travel & Door Progression

Unsafe zones have multiple exits (doors) at the end of a zone segment. Doors determine progression and difficulty, giving players choices on which path to take.

**Rules for door generation:**

- **First 3 unsafe zones after leaving a town:**

  - 3 doors (50% chance for 4)
  - Door 1: 70% chance same tier, 30% higher tier
  - Door 2 & 3: always one tier higher

- **After 3 unsafe zones:**

  - 4 doors (100% chance)
  - Door 1: 70% chance same tier, 30% higher tier
  - Door 2 & 3: always one tier higher
  - Door 4: guaranteed to lead to the next town

This system balances risk, reward, and progression while keeping players aware that **reaching a town requires strategy and survival skills**.

## Gameplay Features

- **Enemy Encounters:** Enemies scale in difficulty based on zone tier. Early zones feature weaker foes; later zones introduce advanced creatures with unique mechanics.
- **Loot & Resources:** Zones contain scattered loot, rare crafting materials, and collectibles. Higher-tier zones increase drop quality.
- **Mini-Activities:** Players may encounter optional tasks such as small puzzles, environmental challenges, or temporary NPC interactions.
- **Exploration Rewards:** Hidden paths and off-path areas reward players with rare loot, crafting materials, or secrets.

## Player Experience

Unsafe zones are meant to feel **alive and dynamic**:

- Exploration is risky but rewarding; choices matter in terms of route and combat engagement.
- Environmental storytelling conveys a sense of **decay, danger, and remnant technology**.
- Procedural variations ensure no two trips feel identical.
- Integration with the MitTech glove allows route mapping, tracking discoveries, and revealing hidden hazards.

## Summary

Unsafe Zones are the core of Another Lands’ **exploration and progression loop**. They:

- Serve as a bridge between towns and hubs
- Introduce risk-reward gameplay
- Provide varied environments, enemies, and loot
- Encourage strategic decision-making for travel and combat

The design ensures that the wildlands are **challenging, engaging, and replayable**, giving players freedom to explore while testing their mastery of the game’s systems.
