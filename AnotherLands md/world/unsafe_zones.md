# 🌲 Unsafe Zones (Wildlands)

## Overview

Unsafe Zones are the areas between towns where the world becomes unpredictable, dangerous, and exploratory. Unlike towns, which act as hubs with crafting, storage, and trading facilities, unsafe zones are procedurally generated for each visit and emphasize **risk, resource gathering, and combat challenge**.

These areas define the `“wildlands”` of Another Lands: the player leaves the safety of civilization and must navigate environmental hazards, enemies, and strategic choices.

## Zone Structure

- **Procedural Generation:** Each visit generates the zone layout dynamically using room templates. Paths may be blocked or unblocked depending on environmental changes (e.g., dried rivers, fallen debris).
- **Exploration Choice:** Players may select difficulty levels for unsafe zones when entering from a town.
- **Environment Types:** Biomes vary, affecting enemies, loot, and hazards:

  - Ruined cities
  - Industrial wastelands
  - Forests with post-tech ruins
  - Desert zones
  - Snowfields or frost areas
  - Arcane anomalies
  - Cave and underground networks

## Travel & Door Progression

Unsafe zones have multiple exits (doors) at the end of a zone segment. Doors determine progression and difficulty, giving players choices on which path to take.

**Rules for door generation:**

- **First 3 unsafe zones after leaving a town:**

  - 3 doors (50% chance for 4)
  - Door 1: 70% chance same tier, 30% higher tier
  - Door 2 & 3: always one tier higher

- **After 3 unsafe zones:**

  - 4 doors (100% chance)
  - Door 1: 70% chance same tier, 30% higher tier
  - Door 2 & 3: always one tier higher
  - Door 4: guaranteed to lead to the next town

This system balances risk, reward, and progression while keeping players aware that **reaching a town requires strategy and survival skills**.

## Gameplay Features

- **Enemy Encounters:** Enemies scale in difficulty based on zone tier. Early zones feature weaker foes; later zones introduce advanced creatures with unique mechanics.
- **Loot & Resources:** Zones contain scattered loot, rare crafting materials, and collectibles. Higher-tier zones increase drop quality.
- **Mini-Activities:** Players may encounter optional tasks such as small puzzles, environmental challenges, or temporary NPC interactions.
- **Exploration Rewards:** Hidden paths and off-path areas reward players with rare loot, crafting materials, or secrets.

## Player Experience

Unsafe zones are meant to feel **alive and dynamic**:

- Exploration is risky but rewarding; choices matter in terms of route and combat engagement.
- Environmental storytelling conveys a sense of **decay, danger, and remnant technology**.
- Procedural variations ensure no two trips feel identical.
- Integration with the MitTech glove allows route mapping, tracking discoveries, and revealing hidden hazards.

## Summary

Unsafe Zones are the core of Another Lands’ **exploration and progression loop**. They:

- Serve as a bridge between towns and hubs
- Introduce risk-reward gameplay
- Provide varied environments, enemies, and loot
- Encourage strategic decision-making for travel and combat

The design ensures that the wildlands are **challenging, engaging, and replayable**, giving players freedom to explore while testing their mastery of the game’s systems.


# ⚖️ Risk Escalation & Run Commitment

Unsafe Zones reward players who push forward without returning to town. Each completed unsafe zone without saving increases the tension of the run, amplifying both danger and opportunity.

Run Commitment
	•	When a player leaves a town, their inventory state is locked and preserved.
	•	Items found in unsafe zones exist only for the duration of the run.
	•	Dying during exploration causes the player to lose only the items gathered in the wildlands, not the equipment or resources secured in town.

This ensures failure results in lost time and opportunity, not permanent progress loss.

Escalating Risk

As players continue through unsafe zones without saving:
	•	Enemy behavior becomes more aggressive and complex.
	•	Environmental hazards appear more frequently or with stronger effects.
	•	Door outcomes trend toward higher-tier zones with fewer safe exits.

The world subtly adapts to the player’s growing confidence.

Escalating Rewards

At the same time, prolonged runs increase potential rewards:
	•	Improved loot quality and rarity.
	•	Access to drop pools unavailable in short or safe runs.
	•	Increased chance for rare events, hidden encounters, or unusual zone modifiers.

Some items and encounters can only appear after extended exploration without saving.

Strategic Town Choice

Towns are not mandatory checkpoints but strategic reset points.
	•	Entering a town allows players to secure loot, recover fully, and reset run tension.
	•	Continuing past a town preserves escalating rewards but increases the risk of losing everything gained since departure.

Players must decide when to stop safely and when to press their luck.

Design Intent

This system encourages:
	•	Greed vs. caution decision-making
	•	Memorable high-risk runs
	•	Natural difficulty scaling driven by player choice
	•	Reduced frustration from death while preserving meaningful stakes

Unsafe Zones are not just paths between towns — they are where players define their own limits.
