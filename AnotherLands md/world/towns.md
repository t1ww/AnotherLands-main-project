# 🏘️ Town System Overview
    Towns act as major hubs in the world, providing facilities for recovery, crafting, progression, and class-specific activities. They serve as safe zones for players to plan, rest, and interact with NPCs before returning to wildlands.

## Core Features

* **Healing & Recovery:** Beds, benches, or NPC healers to restore health and buffs.
* **Merchants & Shops:** Vendors selling potions, ammo, crafting materials, gear, and rare items.
* **Crafting & Storage:** Workshops and storage units for material management and item creation.
* **Class Facilities:** Specialized locations supporting class progression and training (see detailed class facilities below).
* **Quests & Events:** NPCs offering main quests, side quests, and seasonal or random events.
* **Companions & Drones:** Upgrade points or bonding hubs for smart gloves, drones, and familiars.

## Optional / Flavor Features

* Decorative elements (gardens, fountains, campfires).
* Mini-games or leisure activities (board games, musical performances, racing tracks).
* Environmental storytelling: broken buildings, ruins, or landmarks to make each town distinct.

## Purpose

Towns provide a **full-service stop**, unlike filler towns. They allow players to:

1. Heal and recover buffs.
2. Restock and prepare for wildlands.
3. Progress in class-specific systems.
4. Engage in events or mini-quests.
5. Upgrade companions, drones, and equipment.

# ⛺ Filler Towns
    Filler towns are small, functional stops designed to give players a brief respite between wildlands, without being full hubs. They provide essential services and minor interactions, keeping the game flow smooth.

## Minimum Essentials

- **Basic Healing:** An NPC, healing station, or safe bed. Not full recovery—just enough to continue exploring.
- **Small Merchant:** Sells basic supplies such as potions, ammo, repair kits, and emergency food.
- **Rest Zone:** Bed, bench, or safe area where buffs recover and debuffs wear off.
- **Exit Gate:** Clear path to return to surrounding wildlands.

## Optional Extras

- **Random Event:** A traveling NPC offering a mini-game, gear repair, or small trade.
- **Mini-Quest Giver:** Short side tasks like “Find my lost bag nearby” to add engagement.
- **Environmental Flavor:** Decorative elements like campfires, tiny gardens, or broken buildings for atmosphere.

## Summary

Filler towns = heal a bit + stock a bit + continue. They act as tiny oases, keeping players moving without serving as a major hub.
