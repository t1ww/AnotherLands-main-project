## The Three Wandering Merchants

Legends speak of three mysterious merchants who roam the lands, appearing only when the time is right. Their presence is unpredictable, and their past remains a well-kept secret. The stories surrounding them vary—some say they were once heroes during the apocalypse, others believe they made a pact to compete against each other in business. Regardless of the truth, one thing is certain: they never acknowledge each other’s existence, refusing to speak about their past connections.

Each of them has a distinct personality, approach, specialization, and unique appearance that sets them apart.
