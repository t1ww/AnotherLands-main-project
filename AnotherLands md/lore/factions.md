## The Shifters’ Belief

A minority of wanderers, hermits, and cult remnants still speak of **“The Shifts”** —  
they claim dimensional fractures never fully closed, only weakened.  
To them, each strange mutation, spectral echo, or impossible creature is a sign of the rifts stirring again.  

While most scholars dismiss this as folklore or trauma echoing through generations,  
some explorers and drifters swear they’ve seen the light bend wrong in the wilds —  
as if reality itself still remembers where it tore.
