## The Shifters’ Belief

A minority of wanderers, hermits, and old cult remnants still speak of **“The Shifts”** —  
they claim the dimensional fractures never fully closed, only weakened.  
To them, each strange mutation, spectral echo, or twisted creature is a sign of the rifts stirring again.  

What they do not realize is that the breach was long ago sealed—quietly, by hands now forgotten.  
But fear has deep roots.  
Generations have grown under its shadow, and many townsfolk still refuse to travel beyond their walls,  
convinced the outer lands whisper with things that should not exist.
