## The Shift Incident  
*Approx. Year: Unknown — Believed to mark the end of the Pre-Collapse Era*

A catastrophic event known only as **The Shift Incident** fractured the boundary between dimensions.  
For several days—or perhaps weeks, depending on fragmented accounts—creatures and anomalies emerged across the lands.  
Civilizations fell in panic, and many records of the event were lost to fire, flood, and silence.  

What caused the breach remains uncertain:  
some blame failed experiments with ancient tech, others divine punishment, or the collision of planes themselves.  
The modern calendar informally begins “After the Shift,” though even that is debated.
