### Mittech — The Legendary Crafter's Glove

Before the apocalypse, a brilliant inventor known as the Legendary Crafter created Mittech:
a multifunctional glove capable of interacting with the environment, performing complex tasks,
and displaying holographic data—a portable all-in-one device, akin to a magical mobile computer.

Its capabilities made it invaluable. However, a powerful corporate entity stole Mittech,
threatened the Crafter's family, and took control of the device. This event caused
widespread fear and left the Crafter’s work scattered.

Mittech survives into the post-apocalyptic era as a rare relic,
its original functionality intact, waiting for skilled hands to master it.
