# 🔨 Tool’s durability and bondings (Scrapped but please reconsider)
### Tools Bond System & Buffs:
-	**`Bond Tiers:`** Tools grow stronger through player interaction. As players use tools, they build a connection, progressing through different bond tiers. Each tier unlocks new buffs, enhancing the tool’s effectiveness and adding a rewarding progression system.
### Durability & Maintenance:
-	**`Limited Repairs:`** Tools have durability that decreases over time with use. Players can repair tools a limited number of times, but each repair costs resources.
-	**`Tool Bond Influence:`** The stronger the bond, the longer a tool lasts and the more effectively it can be maintained. Players who maintain their tools well can enjoy better performance and longevity.
-	**`Buffs as “Lucky Charm”:`** Buffs are small, positive effects that make gameplay feel rewarding, like extra resources, increased efficiency, or minor boosts to player stats. These aren’t about raw power but rather making the tool feel like a companion, with tangible, enjoyable effects.
### Bond Progression:
-	**`Early Tiers:`** The tool is basic but offers minor buffs like increased resource drops or small efficiency boosts.
-	**`Higher Tiers:`** The tool gains stronger buffs, like luck boosts, random positive effects (e.g., better crit chance), and aesthetic changes (visual/audio cues to show the tool’s growth).
-	**`New Tools & Longer Bonds:`** As players find or craft new tools, they can bond with them just like the old ones, but new tools come with higher initial durability, more repair capacity, and potentially stronger bonds. This creates a natural progression where newer tools eventually replace old ones, but with even more powerful bonds and buffs attached to them.
-	**`Emotional Connection & Progression:`** This system encourages players to keep and maintain tools they’ve developed bonds with, while also introducing the excitement of upgrading and replacing tools. As players care for and maintain their tools, they experience a satisfying growth in both the tool’s power and their own connection to it.

# Scrapped crafting
The twist for precision challenge is, the grids is actually 9 by 9 and the extra is splitting 3 by 3 by another 3, in which you actually just have to put the item in the middle one of those and others extra grids locks your ingredients in place,
The more you put in the extras, the lesser it’s quality is, putting wrong ingredients in those spots completely fails your crafting and you loses that locked ingredient

Just to not really punish bad crafting, those are actually reasonably normal quality, and the good one would be called perfect crafting.
