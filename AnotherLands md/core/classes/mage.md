# Wand — Spell Crafting (Default / Core Mechanic)

## 1. Direct Crafting to Wand

- Spells are crafted **directly into the wand**, not as standalone inventory items. This limits mass-production and encourages revisiting the crafting process each time.
- Editing or removing a spell **returns half of the resources** used.

---

## 2. Runic Language System

- Spell recipes are **sequences of runes**.
- **Lower-tier spells:** Short combinations (2–3 runes) yield something, but weak.
- **Higher-tier spells:** Longer, more precise sequences; trial-and-error becomes harder.
- **Failed combinations** consume all resources but mark the sequence as invalid (prevents retrying).

---

## 3. Resource Cost Scaling

- Longer runic combinations = higher cost (more resources with additional rarer resources).

---

## 4. Hints & Discovery

- Books, scrolls, or NPCs may reveal **partial recipes or clues** for runic combinations.
- Encourages **experimentation, observation, and deduction**.

---

## 5. Logical Rune Effects

Examples:

- `Ign-Tel-Sol` → Fire Wall
- `Aqua-Tel-Sol` → Water Wave
- `Terra-Tel-Sol` → Rock Pillars

- Players learn **patterns intuitively**, not through memorizing exact formulas.

---

## 6. Partial Randomization System

- **Purpose:** Prevents players from becoming overpowered on new playthroughs by reusing previous knowledge.
- **Concept:** Each new world slightly alters core logic or rune rules, so players must **relearn mechanics** each time. Feels like a *multiverse effect* — familiar principles still apply, but outcomes vary.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Introduce **3–4 randomization sets** that slightly modify core rules or rune logic.  
  - Each world selects one set at generation.  
  - Players may occasionally encounter familiar variations in later runs.
- **Effect:** Encourages **experimentation and adaptability** without overwhelming the player, providing replayability through subtle but meaningful differences per world.

# Tome — Casting (Alternative / Advanced Mechanic)

## 1. Page-Based Casting

- Player holds a tome and **switches pages** to select spells.
- Inspired by *Mage Arena*’s “speak spell aloud” system.
- Goal: keep it **hands-on** but without requiring voice input.

---

## 2. Alternative Casting Options

- **Gesture / Motion-Based:** Swipe or drag across pages to “draw” the spell.
- **Runic Patterns:** Trace rune shapes on the tome page to activate spells.
- **Sequence Input:** Quick key sequences corresponding to spell pages.

---

## 3. Intent

- Retains the **ritualistic and skillful** nature of spellcasting.
- Reduces barriers for players who prefer not to use voice input.
- Can be paired with wand mechanics for a **two-layered mage experience** — crafting + casting.
