# Wand — Spell Crafting (Default / Core Mechanic)

## 1. Direct Crafting to Wand
- Spells are crafted **directly into the wand**, not as standalone inventory items.
  - This limits mass-production and encourages revisiting the crafting process each time.
- Editing or removing a spell **returns half of the resources** used.

---

## 2. Runic Language System
- Spell recipes are **sequences of runes**.
- **Lower-tier spells:** Short combinations (2–3 runes) yield weaker but functional results.
- **Higher-tier spells:** Longer, more precise sequences that require insight or references to discover.
- **Failed combinations** consume resources but become marked as invalid, preventing brute-force retries.

---

## 3. Resource Cost Scaling
- Longer or higher-tier combinations **cost exponentially more**, consuming additional rare components.
  - Cost scaling balances experimental crafting and high-tier discovery pacing.

---

## 4. Logical Rune Effects
- Each rune holds **consistent elemental or conceptual meaning**.
  - Example logic patterns:
    - `Ign-Tel-Sol` → Fire Wall
    - `Aqua-Tel-Sol` → Water Wave
    - `Terra-Tel-Sol` → Rock Pillars

- Players learn **intuitive rules** rather than memorizing static formulas.
  - For example, “Ign” relates to heat, “Tel” implies direction or projection, etc.

---

## 5. Hints & Discovery (Grimoire System)
- Higher-level spells cannot be discovered through pure trial and error.
  - Players must **interpret riddles, fragmented scrolls, and grimoires** scattered across the world.

- Texts often contain **partial clues or metaphoric hints** about rune combinations.
  - Example: “The flame’s whisper pierces truth when guided straight.”

- Some writings are **damaged or incomplete**, forcing creative inference or experimentation.
- All texts are written in **stylized English**, maintaining accessibility and immersion.
- This encourages **pattern recognition and logical deduction** over repetition.

---

## 6. Partial Randomization System
- Each world introduces **a unique variation of rune logic**, preventing players from relying on prior runs.
  - The system subtly alters rune interactions or crafting logic.
  - Feels like a *multiverse* effect — familiar but never identical.

- **Implementation:**
  - 3–4 predefined rule sets modify core rune relationships.
  - A random set is selected during world generation.
  - Some players may encounter similar patterns in later playthroughs.

- **Effect:**
  - Encourages **relearning, adaptability, and fresh experimentation** each run.
  - Adds meaningful replayability without overwhelming new players.

---

## 7. Mana Control & Gesture Efficiency
- Players can **cast spells normally** for consistent results.
- Skilled players may **enhance their casting through gestures or mouse movements**.
  - Proper gestures can:
    - Reduce mana consumption.
    - Increase damage or effect potency.
    - Unlock **alternate spell forms** (e.g., dragging straight during a cast turns a Magic Dart into a Piercing Shot).
- Gestures represent **precision and control** — not more power, but refined channeling.
- Some grimoires include **gesture diagrams or hidden instructions**, rewarding curious players.
- Failed or imprecise gestures may cause **unstable effects** such as wasted mana or minor backlash.
- This layer remains **optional**, serving as an expression of mastery for players who wish to deepen their craft.

# Tome — Casting (Alternative / Advanced Mechanic)

## 1. Page-Based Casting
- The player wields a **tome** that contains multiple pages, each bound to a spell.
  - Switching pages changes the active spell for casting.

- Inspired by *Mage Arena*’s “spoken spell” design, adapted into a tactile input system.

---

## 2. Alternative Casting Options
- **Gesture / Motion-Based:**
  - Drag or trace across tome pages to “draw” runes.

- **Runic Patterns:**
  - Manually trace shapes of runes to activate spells.
  
- **Sequence Input:**
  - Quick key or button sequences replicate the rune order for rapid casting.

---

## 3. Intent
- Keeps casting **ritualistic, deliberate, and expressive**, not automated.
- Provides a **skill-based alternative** for players seeking deeper engagement.
- Complements the wand system, creating a **dual mastery loop**:
  - Crafting defines creation.
  - Casting defines execution.
