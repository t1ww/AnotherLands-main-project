Wand Spell Crafting (Default / Core Mechanic)
	1.	Direct Crafting to Wand:
	•	Spells are crafted directly into the wand, not as standalone items in inventory.
	•	Editing/removing a spell returns half the resources used.
	2.	Runic Language System:
	•	Spell recipes are sequences of runes.
	•	Lower-tier spells: Any combination yields something, but weak.
	•	Higher-tier spells: Combinations are longer and more precise; trial-and-error is harder.
	•	Failed combinations consume all resources but mark the sequence as invalid (prevents retrying).
	3.	Resource Cost Scaling:
	•	Longer runic combinations = higher cost (uses rarer or more resources).
	•	Limits mass-production; encourages revisiting the crafting process each time.
	4.	Hints & Discovery:
	•	Books, scrolls, or NPCs can give clues or partial recipes for runic combinations.
	•	Encourages experimentation, observation, and logical deduction.
	5.	Logical Rune Effects:
	•	Example:
	•	Ign-Tel-Sol → Fire Wall
	•	Aqua-Tel-Sol → Water Wave
	•	Terra-Tel-Sol → Rock Pillars
	•	Players learn patterns intuitively rather than memorizing exact formulas.

Tome Casting (Alternative / Advanced Mechanic)
	1.	Page-Based Casting:
	•	Player holds a tome and switches pages to select a spell.
	•	Original inspiration: “speak spell out loud” (Mage Arena style).
	•	Goal: keep it hands-on but without requiring voice input.
	2.	Alternative Casting Options:
	•	Gesture / Motion-Based: Swiping or dragging over the page to “draw the spell.”
	•	Runic Patterns: Player traces rune shapes on the tome page to activate the spell.
	•	Sequence Input: Quick key sequences corresponding to spell pages.
	3.	Intent:
	•	Retains the ritualistic feel and skill element of casting.
	•	Reduces barriers for players who don’t want to use voice commands.
	•	Can be paired with wand mechanics for a two-layered mage experience: crafting + casting.
