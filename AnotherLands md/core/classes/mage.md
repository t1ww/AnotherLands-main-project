# Wand — Spell Crafting (Default / Core Mechanic)

## 1. Direct Crafting to Wand

* Spells are crafted **directly into the wand**, not as standalone inventory items.
* Editing or removing a spell **returns half of the resources** used.

---

## 2. Runic Language System

* Spell recipes are **sequences of runes**.
* **Lower-tier spells:** Any combination yields something, but weak.
* **Higher-tier spells:** Longer, more precise sequences; trial-and-error becomes harder.
* **Failed combinations** consume all resources but mark the sequence as invalid (prevents retrying).

---

## 3. Resource Cost Scaling

* Longer runic combinations = higher cost (rarer or more resources).
* Limits mass-production and encourages revisiting the crafting process each time.

---

## 4. Hints & Discovery

* Books, scrolls, or NPCs may reveal **partial recipes or clues** for runic combinations.
* Encourages **experimentation, observation, and deduction**.

---

## 5. Logical Rune Effects

Examples:

* `Ign-Tel-Sol` → Fire Wall
* `Aqua-Tel-Sol` → Water Wave
* `Terra-Tel-Sol` → Rock Pillars

Players learn **patterns intuitively**, not through memorizing exact formulas.

# Tome — Casting (Alternative / Advanced Mechanic)

## 1. Page-Based Casting

* Player holds a tome and **switches pages** to select spells.
* Inspired by *Mage Arena*’s “speak spell aloud” system.
* Goal: keep it **hands-on** but without requiring voice input.

---

## 2. Alternative Casting Options

* **Gesture / Motion-Based:** Swipe or drag across pages to “draw” the spell.
* **Runic Patterns:** Trace rune shapes on the tome page to activate spells.
* **Sequence Input:** Quick key sequences corresponding to spell pages.

---

## 3. Intent

* Retains the **ritualistic and skillful** nature of spellcasting.
* Reduces barriers for players who prefer not to use voice input.
* Can be paired with wand mechanics for a **two-layered mage experience** — crafting + casting.
