## 🔨Crafting System ⛏️:
Crafting will draw inspiration from *Minecraft-style speed crafting*, using 3x3 with possibly custom irregular grids. The intended item’s outline will appear faintly on the grid as a reference.

Players use their `hotbar (1–9 bindable slots)` and can quickly swap materials between mouse and hotbar with keybinds. An additional 9 inventory slots are reserved for crafting materials.

Complex items require `sequential crafting` — players must first craft individual components from raw materials before assembling the final product.

The `quality result` depends on crafting speed, with each quality tier applying a multiplier to the item’s base stats.

### Quality Tiers:

  - Bad — ×0.75
  - Normal — ×1.00
  - Perfect — ×1.25
  - Unreal — ×1.50

*There may also be leaderboard for it*

*Crafting may include procedures of crafting each component of the item before putting them together.*
